See Spring Unfold

From the first shoots nudging through thawing soil to meadows brushed with colour, Alberta’s spring is a story told in stages. We’ll help you spot what’s in bloom, where to walk, and when to look—so each visit feels like good timing.

## COLUMN 2

Grow It. Guard It.

Native plants do more than look lovely—they feed bees, shelter butterflies, and steady fragile habitats. Fabled Flora celebrates Alberta’s wild flora with practical guidance for pollinator-friendly gardens, drought-wise planting, and small choices that make a big ecological difference.
